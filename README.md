## How it Works

Can add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, and square any Quaternary number (using the integers 0, 1, 2, 3 and any combination of those integers together ex. 12 + 12). You cannot chain operations like 1 + 1 + 1, but you can do 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. 
You can switch to decimal when you can add anything, it will force you back into Quaternary.
